# Pipeline-special-effects
Two demos about pipeline special effects based on three.js and cesium

The first demo named transparent_pipe_line shows the effect of water flowing in a transparent pipe.

Another file named 'cesium.html' dsplays the dynamic flow derection of the pipeline.

Basic theory of the above two projects are based on the texture loop of pipes.
